Hi there! Today, We want to share with you a vision of a world may not exist today, but there is a lot of work going on allowing for make it possible. Such vision has its origins on a line of thought We decided to name as the **Utopian philosophy**.

The Utopian philosophy it's based on the fact that *some companies and start-ups are built as a mean for making money instead of a mean for impacting people's lives—i.e., to contribute to society*. Which, some authors consider is the cause for other problems such as: toxic work environments, unfulfilled employees, mass-layoffs, and so on. The **Utopian philosophy** purpose is to establish a set beliefs allowing for solving such problems. We believe this can be done by putting people before money. Our vision of the world is based on *a world where companies and start-ups are built as mean for impacting people's lives. A world where every company has a greater cause they want to achieve. They may not even get there in a lifetime, but their hope is to left the world in better form than they found it.*

We decide to create UtopianView as mean for building such vision of the world. Our aim is gathering common practices allowing for creating Utopian companies—*i.e.*, companies who believe what we believe. We'll analyze different works and authors which clearly have an *utopian view* of the world. They may be called crazies for the things they state, but We deeply know they stand for something greater than themselves. As a result, we hope to shed some lights in the path of building *Utopian companies*.

Some of the authors We follow are: Simon Sinek, Adam Grant, Eric Ries, Robert Quinn, Wayne Dyer, and Tom Bilyeu. We'll continue adding authors to this list as We consider necessary.
